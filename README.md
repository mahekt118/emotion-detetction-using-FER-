# Real-Time Emotion Detection Using FER Library

This repository contains a Python script that uses the [FER library](https://github.com/justinshenk/fer) to detect emotions in real-time through a webcam feed. The application captures video frames, processes them using the FER library, and overlays the detected dominant emotion on the video feed.

## Features
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection:** Utilizes a webcam to detect emotions live.
- **FER Library:** Leverages the FER Python library for state-of-the-art facial emotion recognition.
- **Emotion Annotation:** Draws bounding boxes around faces and displays the dominant emotion.
- **Interactive:** Displays video output with annotations in real-time.
